This error occurs when using the `useCallback` hook in React Native with a function that depends on a state variable.  If the state variable changes, the function inside `useCallback` should ideally not re-render. However, if the function itself references the state variable directly, it will be re-created even with `useCallback`, leading to unexpected behavior. This is because `useCallback` only memoizes the function itself, not its dependencies.

```javascript
import React, { useState, useCallback } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Incorrect: count is a closure that changes
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={increment} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
